Contributing
============
BibViz has come a long way in just such a short time. I'd like to thank the prominent blogs and news sources that shared a link to the site, and everyone who shared on social media, forums, and their personal blogs as well. Hundreds of thousands of people have visited BibViz in the past two months and many have already written me with feedback or left comments. The response to BibViz has been more than I could have ever imagined!

While I plan to continue working on the project, I would like to take this opportunity to request that others who are interested in helping might lend a hand. I have put up a list of contribution ideas on the [Github project page](http://github.com/danielgtaylor/bibviz) that I will reproduce here:

 * [Translations](http://bibviz.com/translate.html)
 * New data sources for `web/contents/data/contra.json`
 * Additional visualizations using D3.js
 * Blog entries
 * Meta-analysis of all data sets
 * Tagging contradictions by severity
 * Tagging contradictions by Christian sect beliefs
 * Support for newer Bible versions (e.g. NIV, ESV)
   * Part of this work would be tagging contradictions by version
 * Tagging contradictions with Christian responses
 * Style, script, page, and search optimizations

Many of these ideas don't require technical skills like programming or web development. In particular, I'd love to get some high quality translations into various languages. Others could use the help of experts in data visualization (I'm not one of them).

New blog posts could use people more familiar with the history of the Bible than I am. I would love to have blog posts written by different people from different perspectives. It seems easy enough to choose a particular contradiction or issue and write an article about it. The blog uses Markdown for formatting, but you can use your favorite editor and I can handle formatting.

I have gotten a lot of great feedback so far. I'd love to see more.
