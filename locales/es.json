"I hope to show that while the Bible may have much to offer us,
 biblical inerrancy and morality are not what it offers. Without inerrancy it's simple to see that we just do not know which parts are the word or will of God. Basing our morality on vile,
 disgusting stories from a long-forgotten era of humanity in a part of the world many have never even seen seems silly to me. What the Bible does offer us is an amazing look into humanity,
 our past,
 our desires and our fears.":"Espero mostrar que mientras la Biblia tiene mucho qué ofrecernos,
 la inerrancia bíblica y la moralidad no son lo que ofrece. Sin inerrancia es fácil ver que simplemente no sabemos qué partes son la palabra o voluntad de Dios. Basar nuestra moralidad en historias viles y repugnantes de una era olvidada de la humanidad en una parte del mundo que muchos tal vez ni siquiera han visto me parece ridículo. Lo que la Biblia si nos ofrece es un vistazo grandioso a la humanidad,
 nuestro pasado,
 nuestros deseos y miedos.",
